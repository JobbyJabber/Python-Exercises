Birthday Paradox, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
--snip--
How many birthdays shall I generate? (Max 100)
> 23
Here are 23 birthdays:
Oct 9, Sep 1, May 28, Jul 29, Feb 17, Jan 8, Aug 18, Feb 19, Dec 1, Jan 22,
May 16, Sep 25, Oct 6, May 6, May 26, Oct 11, Dec 19, Jun 28, Jul 29, Dec 6,
Nov 26, Aug 18, Mar 18
In this simulation, multiple people have a birthday on Jul 29
Generating 23 random birthdays 100,000 times...

Let's run another 100,000 simulations.

Out of 100,000 simulations of 23 people, there was a
matching birthday in that group 50955 times. This means
that 23 people have a 50.95 % chance of
having a matching birthday in their group.
That's probably more than you would think!
